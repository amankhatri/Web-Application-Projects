<!-- padding: it is very similar to margin, instead of moving the entire div it moves the text inside the div. Also if we look at the page we know that there is too much distance in the text inside the div tag that is because of p tag , it has padding inbuilt so we would have to set the padding and margin of the p tag to be zero. you can do padding : top right bottom left , and if you only give two out of 4 paddings it will repeat the padding  . you can also do padding-left: leftpx; padding-right: rightpx and etc-->
