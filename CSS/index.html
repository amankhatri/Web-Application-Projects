 <!-- so what if we would want to make different paragraphs with different styles we would have to classify each paragraph in different class or ids. Class may refer to more then one elements , but ids refer to one/single element i.e which would appear once for one element..
  -->
 <!-- large referes to the class and we use a dot(.) in front of a class in css-->
<!-- green referes to the id and we use a dot(#) in front of a id in css we can also apply id to a class-->
<!--divs are always rectangular and covers the area around them they can also be used to control the sections look in css div -->
