    <!-- In line CSS -->
    <!--to use inline css we give a style option in the tags, putting font-size as  200% imakes the size twice. However this is not a good idea because we want to keep our code simple. we can achieve the same by doing internal css which is css in same HTML page. -->
    <p style="color:blue;font-size:200%">This domain is established to be used for illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in examples without prior coordination or asking for permission.</p>
