<!--Padding: It is very similar to margins. creats padding all the way
around the text in the content of .purplebox. However this may look uneven that is because p tag has inbuilt padding in it-. However that is cheating. so to get the same effect by not removing p tag. we would have to set the margins and paddings and margins of p tag to zero. we do not need
px in when the padding is 0 we can do same thing as we did for margins to mention padding on top right bottom left ; however if we only mention two out of three attributes of padding it will make a retagular padding. for example padding:10px 100px; will making padding of 10px at top, 100px in right , 10px at bottom and 100px at left. when we add padding to anything we are adding to width and height of div, we can also do padding-left/right/top/bottom:  -->
